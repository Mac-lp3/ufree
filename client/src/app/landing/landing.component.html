      <p>When you create an event, it is assigned a unique URL. Don't loose it.
      </p>
      <p>Anyone with the URL can add information. Send it to your buddies so
        they can add their dates.
      </p>
      <p>After 10 days of no activity, the event is automatically deleted.</p>
      <p>Since anybody with the URL can see and add dates to your event, no
        personal info and try to keep the URL secret.
